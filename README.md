# Copboard
A leaderboard which lists cops. Basically a discord bot which helps Me, Nehan and Arthob keep track of all the cops we do. This bot acts as a system for storing and allows for us 3 to rate each others cop and essentially measure who is better at copping. 

## Running
You need to create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and fill it with your token like so
```
TOKEN=yourtokenhere
```
After which you need to install the dependencies
```
npm install 
```
Once thats done just start the bot
```
npm run start
```
You can also start it with `nodemon` by simply running 
```
npm run dev
```
Thats it.
